Hi, I am Idan, a research sceintist at Sony Israel. My position is academically inclined, aiming at producing research papers in machine learning. 
I am always looking for collaborations, so if you want to work together please don't hesitate to reach out.
I hold a Ph.D. from Bar-Ilan University where I was supervised by Prof. Gal Chechik (CS department and NVIDIA), and Dr. Ethan Fetaya (EE department). 
I am interested in both theoretical and practical aspects of machine and deep learning across various domains, e.g., images, texts, speech, and exact science.
In general I find the probablistic interperation of ML most compelling. 
Most recently I am working on probabilistic generative models and Bayesian modeling.
I hold a MSc in Computer Science and a BSc in Industrial Engineering, both with honors. Before my MSc degree, I worked for several years as a 
Data Scientist at RSA. <br>
